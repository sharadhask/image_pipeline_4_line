function [int, count, msg] = pnmpnmgeti(fid, n)
%PNMPNMGETI Get integers from an ASCII encoded PBM/PGM/PPM file.
%
%   [INT, COUNT, MSG] = PNMPNMGETI(FID, N) tries to read N integers from the
%   ASCII encoded PBM/PGM/PPM file with file identifier FID and returns the
%   integers in the vector INT.  COUNT is the number of values successfully
%   read.  MSG is an error message string if an error occurred, and an empty
%   matrix if an error did not occur.
%
%   If N is omitted, PNMPNMGETI reads from the current file position to the end
%   of the file.
%
%   The main difference between PNMPNMGETI(FID) and FSCANF(FID, '%d') is that
%   PNMPNMGETI ignores PBM/PGM/PPM comments (which begin at a `#' character and
%   go to the end of line).  PNMPNMGETI also ignores garbage, which is anything
%   that is neither whitespace, digit nor comment.
